# Drag and Drop | ZTM JS Web Projects Course

**Project 16/20**

A fully interactive **Kanban Board** with drag-and-drop functionality that lets you organize tasks across different columns: *Backlog*, *Progress*, *Complete*, and *On Hold*. Tasks are saved to **localStorage**, so your board state is preserved even after refreshing the page.
